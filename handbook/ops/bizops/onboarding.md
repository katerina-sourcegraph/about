# BizOps onboarding

Welcome! We're so excited to have you join the BizOps team. This document outlines the structure of your first few weeks at Sourcegraph.

Week 1

You'll have to get some basics set up in your first few days:

- Complete [general onboarding](../../people-ops/onboarding/general_onboarding.md)

### Understand company and team values and goals

- [Sourcegraph FY22 OKRs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18d3sX38O6ephNuoHqZT9BwU1m1_FGuRfsTwYbc8lMV8/edit#heading=h.obnaanj0svtb)

### Training sessions
- Product demo (including context into different parts of the product)
- Google BigQuery through Looker walkthrough

### Get to know fellow teammates

Weeks 2 and 3

- Your manager and you will work together to find good onboarding projects that combine your areas of interest with real problems we need to solve. These projects should:
    - Familiarize you with our tech stack (HubSpot/Salesforce for customer ops roles and BigQuery/Looker for product ops roles)
    - Reinforce our value propositions to different personas
    - Include collaboration with another team to start building familiarity with how other teams operate
    - Be opportunities for you to get a quick win or two!
- Continue asking questions about Sourcegraph (the company and product) and reinforcing our values and goals. 
-
